# Filter and Embedded Feature Selection Techniques for Malware Classification

This project explores the integration of filter and embedded feature selection techniques to enhance the classification of malware and goodware samples based on API calls. Filter techniques, specifically Chi2 and Gini, are employed to pre-select relevant features, while embedded techniques, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Extra Tree, and Lasso, are also utilized.

## Overview

Malware poses a significant threat to cybersecurity, and its detection and classification are critical for safeguarding computer systems and data. This project focuses on leveraging feature selection techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of malware classification based on API calls.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing, comprising API call sequences from malware and goodware samples.
- This directory contains API categorization of each API used in the dataset.
- This directory stores the results of the experiments, including feature scores, for each feature model.
